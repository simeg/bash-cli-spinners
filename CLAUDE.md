# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Bash/Zsh loading spinner library that provides multiple loading indicators for shell scripts. The project is currently in early development stage with only basic documentation files present.

## Repository Structure

The repository currently contains:
- `README.md` - Basic project description
- `LICENSE` - MIT license
- No source code files yet (spinner implementations to be added)

## Development Notes

- This is a shell script library focused on Bash/Zsh compatibility
- The library will offer five different loading spinner types
- No build system, test framework, or linting tools are currently configured
- Pure shell script implementation (no external dependencies expected)

## Future Development

When implementing spinners:
- Follow shell scripting best practices
- Ensure compatibility with both Bash and Zsh
- Consider terminal compatibility and cursor control sequences
- Implement clean start/stop mechanisms for each spinner type
